# visual-search-neural-net
A neural network created to model visual search results from the Vision Lab at University of Illinois. 

Buetti et al. (2016) reported that, contrary to what was previously thought, systematic variability exists in efficient ("popout") search. Reaction times increased logarithmically as a function of set size, suggesting that Stage 1 of visual search is exhaustive.

This neural network is an attempt to model the cognitive processes reported in papers from our lab (see below).
